# Day of AI — Teacher-Trainer Preparation Guide

This document provides a complete overview of how **Day of AI teacher-trainers** are prepared, what curriculum MIT offers to them, and how countries adapt and scale the program.  
It includes:

- Introduction  
- Section 1 — Curriculum for Teacher-Trainers  
- Section 2 — Materials MIT Provides  
- Section 3 — Structure of Train-the-Trainer Programs  
- Section 4 — International Adaptations  
- Section 5 — Summary Table

## 🧑‍🏫 Introduction Curriculum for Teacher-Trainers (Meta-Pedagogy)

Day of AI uses a **cascade training model**:

**MIT → National Training Partners → Local Teacher-Trainers → Classroom Teachers → Students**

Teacher-trainers are prepared not only in **AI content knowledge**, but also in **pedagogy**, **local adaptation**, **facilitation skills**, and **school-level implementation logistics**.  
The goal is to ensure that trainers can confidently teach *teachers*, many of whom have no background in computer science.

---

### 1. Curriculum for Teacher-Trainers (Meta-Pedagogy)

#### A. Foundations of AI (Content Knowledge)

Teacher-trainers must master the same fundamental concepts teachers will later deliver:

- What AI is and is not  
- Machine learning basics (supervised, unsupervised, features, labels)  
- Classification systems  
- Training data, bias, representativeness  
- Computer vision fundamentals  
- Natural language processing basics  
- Societal impacts of AI  
- Responsible AI and ethics

This builds confidence and conceptual accuracy before tackling pedagogy.

---

#### B. Pedagogical Approaches for Teaching AI to Teachers

MIT trains trainers to teach teachers using:

- High-scaffolding pedagogy for non-technical teachers  
- Unplugged simulations of AI processes  
- Structured discussions (ethics, implications, fairness)
